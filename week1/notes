My public learning journey through DevOps and AWS â€“ with weekly notes, tools, projects, and hands-on progress updates.
# My AWS & DevOps Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my personal repository documenting my deep dive into the world of DevOps principles and Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing! This space will chronicle my learning path, including foundational concepts, practical labs, and small projects.

My goal is to understand how modern applications are built, deployed, and managed efficiently in the cloud.

## Week 1: Cloud Foundations & Automation Insights

This past week has been an incredible kickstart! I've covered core DevOps concepts, understood the essence of cloud computing, and gotten hands-on with fundamental AWS services like IAM and EC2.

### Key Learnings This Week:

* **What is DevOps?** A process focused on improving application delivery by ensuring there is automation, code quality, continuous monitoring, and continuous testing. It aims to bridge the gap between development and operations for smoother, more efficient pipelines.
* **The Power of the Cloud:** Understood the "cloud" as a collection of remote servers for on-demand access to files, applications, and data. Explored its benefits like accessibility, scalability, cost-effectiveness, flexibility, collaboration, and disaster recovery. My focus is on AWS.
* **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):** Learned about the industry-standard process for designing, developing, and testing high-quality products, covering phases like Planning, Defining, Building, Testing, and Deployment.
* **AWS Account Setup:** Successfully created my AWS account, navigating through root user setup, credit card verification (aware of Free Tier limits), and identity confirmation.
* **Virtual Machines (VMs):** Explored VMs as software-based emulations of physical computers, enabling multiple OS and applications on a single machine, created by Hypervisors.
* **AWS Global Infrastructure:** Understood AWS's global presence including regions, availability zones, data centers, edge locations, and points of presence. Learned about choosing regions based on compliance, latency, and service availability.
* **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Delved into IAM, AWS's global service for managing users and groups. Learned about the importance of the least privilege principle and assigning permissions via JSON-based policies.
* **Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2):** Got hands-on with EC2, AWS's service for virtual machines (instances).
    * **AWS CLI:** Installed the AWS Command Line Interface on my local system for terminal access to instances.
    * **Instance Launch:** Successfully launched an EC2 instance (Amazon Linux 2 AMI, t2.micro).
    * **Security Groups:** Configured security groups as virtual firewalls to control inbound (e.g., SSH on port 22, HTTP on port 80) and outbound traffic.
    * **User Data:** Utilized EC2 user data to automate web server installation and start-up upon instance launch.
    * **Instance Management:** Understood how to start, stop, and terminate instances, and the behavior of public/private IPs.
    * **Cost Optimization:** Explored various EC2 instance types and cost-saving options like Spot Instances and Reserved Instances.
    * **EC2 Instance Connect:** Learned about browser-based SSH access without managing SSH keys.

### Featured Project: My First AWS EC2 Web Server Lab

This week, I successfully launched an EC2 instance and deployed a basic web server using user data. This hands-on lab demonstrated key concepts of cloud compute and networking.

### What's Next?

Excited to continue building on these fundamentals! Next week, I plan to explore:

* AWS Storage Services (S3, EBS)
* Networking concepts (VPC, Subnets)
* Further diving into automation tools and scripting.
